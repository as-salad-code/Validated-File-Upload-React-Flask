# Validated File Upload with React and Flask

This project demonstrates a file upload system implemented using React for the front end and Flask for the back end. It includes validation for file type, file size, and appointment date and time.

## Features

- Allows users to upload files along with selecting appointment date and time.
- Validates the selected file's type and size.
- Validates the appointment date to ensure it falls within the next 30 days.
- Validates the appointment time to ensure it falls between 8 am and 7 pm.
- Provides visual feedback during the upload process with a progress bar.
- Displays error messages if any validation fails.

## Technologies Used

- React: Front end framework for building user interfaces.
- Flask: Python web framework for building the back end server.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests from the React application.
- CSS: Used for styling the components and layout.
